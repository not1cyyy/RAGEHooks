# RAGEHooks

This repository contains the source code for the [RAGEHooks](https://pekora.zip).

We are open sourcing this project to demonstrate transparency. Some users have mistakenly labeled Korone as a **RAT (Remote Access Trojan)** this code proves that RAGEHooks is completely safe.

This is legacy code from 2024 when I was just starting out with C++
